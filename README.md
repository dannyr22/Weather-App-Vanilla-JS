#  Weather App 

##  Made in vanilla JS with some Bootstrap 

This is a simple weather app, made with the aim to practise my vanilla JS skills with no use of a framework. The home screen is a simple input field which requires the user to pick a city in order to see it's weather conditions.


After the user submits a city name
* the app sends an api request to Accu weather to get the city id
* Then with that id sends another request for the weather conditions of that city
* The information is then displayed nicely in the UI on a card made with Bootstrap 
* The previous city information is then put into Local storage to open automatically the next time the user opens the app.
